# studying

A simple Python3 script (in swedish) for studying.
Currently only compatible with Windows computers.

## TODO:

- Add explanation for each tag in help
- Add explanation for each filter in help
- Make compatible with all operating systems
- Writing numbers after "återgå till plugget?" should make next study session that many minutes long
- Clear console when script started
- Add option -v, --overview to readLog.py that display the amount of time studied and paused, in time (hours?) and percentages of study session
