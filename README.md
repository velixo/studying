## TODO:

- Make compatible with all operating systems
- Writing numbers after "återgå till plugget?" should make next study session that many minutes long
- Clear console when script started
- Add option -o, --overview to readLog.py that display the amount of time studied and paused, in time (hours?) and percentages of study session
- Add filter option to show seconds in readLog.py -f
- Add timestamp to pause start
- Add date to logging timestamp
